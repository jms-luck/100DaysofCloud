Virtual Machine Deploymen# Day 2: Virtual Machine Deployment in Azure

## Topics Covered:
1. **Overview of Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)**:
   - Understanding the purpose and use cases for Azure VMs.
   - Benefits of cloud-hosted virtual machines.

2. **Deploying a Virtual Machine**:
   - Selecting an operating system (Windows/Linux).
   - Choosing the VM size and region.
   - Setting up admin credentials and network configurations.

3. **Networking for Virtual Machines**:
   - Configuring Network Security Groups (NSGs).
   - Setting up public and private IP addresses.

4. **Accessing the Virtual Machine**:
   - Using RDP for Windows VMs.
   - Using SSH for Linux VMs.

5. **Scaling and Monitoring**:
   - Overview of scaling options (vertical and horizontal).
   - Monitoring performance using Azure Monitor.

## Key Learnings:
1. **Flexible Deployment**:
   - Learned to deploy VMs tailored to specific workloads.
   - Explored the Azure portal for a guided deployment experience.

2. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Configured NSGs for access control.
   - Practiced using strong admin credentials.

3. **Performance Management**:
   - Discovered how to monitor CPU, memory, and network usage.
   - Reviewed options for scaling based on workload demands.

## Hands-on Tasks:
- Deployed a Linux-based VM in the **East US** region.
- Configured SSH keys for secure access.
- Set up a custom NSG rule to allow HTTP traffic.
