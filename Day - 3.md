## 📝 Notes

- **Azure SQL Database** does not use the same version as SQL Server.
- It is a managed cloud database that follows a **versionless model**, meaning Microsoft handles updates and improvements behind the scenes.
- This allows **seamless upgrades**, **security patches**, and **performance improvements** without manual intervention.
- Some **features** and **syntax** may differ between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.
