## Day 3: Introduction to Azure Database Services

📌 **Topics Covered**
- Introduction to Database Services on Azure
- Creating an Azure SQL Server using the Azure Portal
- Creating an Azure SQL Database
- Adding Tables to the Azure Database

📝 **Notes**
- Azure SQL Database does not use the same version as SQL Server.
- It is a managed cloud database that follows a versionless model, meaning Microsoft handles updates and improvements behind the scenes.
- This allows seamless upgrades, security patches, and performance improvements without manual intervention.
- Some features and syntax may differ between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.
