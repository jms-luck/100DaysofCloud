## üìù Notes  

- **Azure OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** is a feature of **Azure AI Services** that enables text extraction from images and scanned documents.  
- It supports **printed and handwritten text recognition**, making it useful for applications like document digitization, form processing, and medical applications.  
- **Azure Computer Vision API** provides **OCR capabilities** to extract structured and unstructured text data.  

### üè• **Use Case in My Project**  

- Used **Azure OCR** to **recognize handwritten text** in **medical prescriptions**.  
- The system extracts **doctor's handwritten notes**, **medicine names**, and **dosage instructions** from scanned prescriptions.  
- Integrated **Azure Computer Vision API** with **Python** to process the prescription images and extract meaningful data.  
- Improved **accuracy by pre-processing images** using **OpenCV** (e.g., noise reduction, thresholding).
